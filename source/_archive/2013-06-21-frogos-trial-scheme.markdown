###What about Frog 3?

###And, What About Frog Developer Platform?
{% img left /assets/images/posts/frogos-trial-scheme/frog-developer-platform-game-centre.jpg 400 295 Pin-Point %}
At the moment you are still required to use the Frog 3 Developer platform, where widget can be embeded into pages in a simmilar manner a sandboxed iframe.
There is also an issue with handling the height of the xhtml document which is smaller than it should be but behaves correctly in Frog 3.
Hopefully Frog will release more API features to FrogOS aswell as the option to request several diffrent calls at once, due to the fact that they are sent individual via a proxy and there is a limit of 50/100 returned values on most commands.

###Is it ready do be deployed?
No.
