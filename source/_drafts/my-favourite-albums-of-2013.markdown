#####My Bloody Valentine
*Favorite Track: in another way*

It's not often that I wait until 04:30AM to download an album on launch when the server was not prepared for so many page requests. I certainly was not the only person hyped to listen to this album.

Unlike there previous album (released 22 years ago) the tracks don't not flow in a consistent manner but are split into 3 groups of 3 tracks: the first being in a similar vain to Loveless, the second with a more pop oriented and less guitar based sound, and the last where the group explorer different sounds including drum & bass and a jet plane sample.

Although I did not enjoy this album as much as there previous releases Loveless. Nor is the production quality near as good.I'm happy that the band did make a carbon copy of there past album and explorer new territory.
