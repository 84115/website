    <p>James is one of the best front and backend developers I had pleasure working with. Reliable, owns his tasks and makes sure all requirements are met. If I had to hire a developer he would be on the top of my list. Constantly seeking new challenges and learning. Development for James is a passion. He can communicate his ideas with ease and is open to feedback. Understands how to collaborate with design. Great guy and a team player.</p>
