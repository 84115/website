I have worked as a web developer for various companies in north east of the UK for nine years.

I've always considered going freelance but I'd always been concerned about sustaining consistent work on a full time basis.

Then one day I'd rcieved a call from my manager that the company I was working at was going to cease operating at the end of the next month.

So then I had two choices; I could either look for a full time job again, or instead take the chance and  to do freelancing and work for myself instead.

In hindsight I'm much happier, not tied to 9-5 working hours and enjoy the wider variety of work.

<!-- ### Finding Clients
Thankfully I've not really had to advertise in the two years I've been freelancing.
Word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising, and when I broke the news I was going freelance and immediately had a few enquiries.
With the ball rolling I've had enough enquiries through Twitter and email to keep myself busy.
Maintaining an active profile on a real-time social networking website like Twitter is vital, as well as other social networks such as LinkedIn. -->

### Income
It's incredibly satisfying doing your end-of-year accounts and seeing you've had a successful year. Just make sure to calculate how much tax and national insurance you'll owe.

Id reccoment to save one third of your income to put aside for taxes and national insurance. If you need an estimate of I'd suggest visiting [Listentotaxman](https://listentotaxman.com)
Although I haven't done this for my first year; lots of things you can write off a tax-deductable.
Things like online learning platforms, hosting and domain name payments, and portions of your rent and utility bills if you work from home can all be taken of the amount you pay tax on.

<!-- ### To Set Up a Company or to be Self Employed?
I also had to make the decision of setting up as a sole trader or a limited company when going freelance. I choose sole trader for various reasons.

Running a limited company involves more paperwork. I'd also be the only person in the “company” but limited companies require a minimum of two directors (and a secretary). I'd have to name another person as part of the company just to set it up, which just seemed like hassle. The rules on limited companies have since changed, and that only one director is needed.

Finances also work differently. As a sole trader, I am the company so my finances are the company's and vice versa. In a limited company, I'd be an employee and would have to take money as dividends. As I rent my apartment, being a sole trader means I can continue paying my rent as normal without having to take money from the company every month to pay my rent (and bills). -->

### Will I return To Full Time Employment?
Will I go back to full time employment? It would have to be a really interesting position.
As I say, I'm happy being freelance and enjoying the work and working for myself more than when I was in full time employment.

### On a Final Note
I'm not sure how to end this post, but if you've recently went freelance I'd like to know your experiences too.
And if you're thinking about going freelance, then all I can suggest is go for it!
